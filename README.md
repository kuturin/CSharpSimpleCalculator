A simple calculator application written in C# using Windows Forms (.NET Framework 4.8).  
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, powers, roots, and logarithms, with a clear and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Exponentiation (power) and roots
- Logarithm with custom base
- Support for negative and floating-point numbers
- Parentheses for grouping operations (basic support)
- Clear (CE) and reset functionality
- Operation history display

## Usage

1. **Enter numbers** using the digit buttons (0-9) and the decimal point.
2. **Choose an operation** (+, -, *, /, ^, √, log) as needed.
3. **Press `=`** to calculate the result.
4. **Use CE** to remove the last digit, or **Reset** to clear the entire calculation.
5. The current input is shown in the main display, and the operation history is shown above.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.8
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer (recommended for development)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project (`F5`).

## Notes

- Logarithm: To calculate log<sub>b</sub>(a), enter `a`, press `log`, then enter `b`, and press `=`.
- Roots: To calculate the n-th root of a, enter `a`, press `√`, then enter `n`, and press `=`.
- Negative numbers are supported.

## Future Plans
